This github repository is used to develop and maintain Dash natively built
and packaged for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

The source packages are housed directly within this repository. For more about
the source packages and build instructions, please visit this link:
<https://github.com/taw00/dashcore-rpm/blob/master/README.source.md>

**Binary (executable) RPMs are pre-built for you (from these sources) and are
available through external repositories that your packaging system can
understand.** This makes deploying and maintaining Dash on a Fedora, CentOS, or
RHEL system dependable, more secure, and oh so very simple. This is arguably
the simplest way to deploy and manage a Dash Wallet, Node, or Masternode. For
more about the available binary RPMs, please visit this link:

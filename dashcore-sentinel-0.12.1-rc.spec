# This is the source spec for building the Dash Core Masternode Sentinel
# toolchain required to operate a Dash Core Masternode. It will build the
# dashcore-sentinel package.

# Enjoy. Todd Warner <t0dd@protonmail.com>


# To produce a debuginfo package:
#   1. Comment out this define
#   2. Separate the %'s from their variable (this screws things up)
# Otherwise, leave it uncommented

# "bump" refers to "release bump" and is a build identifier For full releases,
# one will often just name this a numberal for every build: 1, 2, 3, etc. For
# more experimental builds, one will often just make it a date 20160405, or a
# date with a numeral, like 20160405.0, 20160405.1, etc.
# Use whatever is meaningful to you. Just remember if you are iterating, it needs
# to be consistent an progress in version (so that upgrades work)
%define bump rc.1

# "bumptag" is used to indicate additional information, usually an identifier,
# like the builder's initials, or a date, or both, or nil.
# Example, the original builder was "taw" or "Todd Warner", so he would use .taw
# Note: If the value is not %{nil} there needs to be a . preceding this value
# For final releases, one will often opt to nil-out this value.

%description
Dash Core Sentinel is an autonomous agent for persisting, processing and
automating Dash v12.1 governance objects and tasks, and for expanded functions
in the upcoming Dash v13 release (Evolution).

Sentinel is implemented as a Python application that binds to a local version
12.1 dashd instance on each Dash v12.1 Masternode.

Dash (Digital Cash) is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that offers
instant transactions (InstantSend), private transactions (PrivateSend) and token
fungibility. Dash operates a decentralized governance and budgeting system,
making it the first decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Dash is also a
platform for innovative decentralized crypto-tech.

Dash is open source and the name of the overarching project. Learn more
at www.dash.org.
